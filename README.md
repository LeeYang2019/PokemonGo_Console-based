# PokemonGo_Console-based

<Strong>Description</Strong>

I created a simplified version of the video game Pokemon Go. Rather than a video game, this program is console-based. In this version of PokemonGo, the player (PokemonTrainer) encounters Pokemon in the wild and tries to catch them to build his or her collection. The player may transfer Pokemon to the Professor to earn candies.

Sometimes, Pokemon escape from the trainer and are not caught. A PokemonTrainer has a Pokedex (list of Pokemon) which keeps track of which Pokemon the trainer has encountered in the wild (including Pokemon that escaped). The Pokedex stores data in the form of PokemonSpecies which contains information such as the PokedexNumber and PokemonSpeciesName. If a Pokemon is caught, then candies and the Pokemon itself are also stored.

Each Pokemon in the Trainer’s inventory has a certain level of combat power which reflects its ability to win battles with other Pokemon. A player can have multiple Pokemon of the same species but with varying combat powers (or even multiple Pokemon of the same species with the same combat power).

The game play allows the player to search for Pokemon (encounters), display the Pokemon in their Pokedex (encountered Pokemon), display the Pokemon in their inventory (capturedPokemon), transfer captured Pokemon, and quit.

At the end of game play, the player’s progress is saved. This allows the player to resume playing at a later time.

<Strong>Goals</Strong>

The following are what I learned from the project:

		Developed and ran multi-class Java programs.
		Used command-line arguments. (Eclipse: must set program configuration parameters.)
		Throw exceptions at the point the error is detected.
		Catch exceptions where they can be handled as required by program specifications.
		Performed console and file I/O.
		Read text file input via java.util.Scanner
		Wrote output to a text file via java.io.PrintWriter.
